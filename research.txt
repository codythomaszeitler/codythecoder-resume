So there are going to be two main elements that are in play here.

The first element is the top of the page which houses the imge and the two text fields.

The second element is everything else on the page.

(I wonder how you can figure out if you need custom js or not)

Whenever you scroll down on the page, two things should happen:
1) First, the top imge must become more (clear? / opaque? don't remember the term)

2) Second, the entire bottom portion of the website should start to move

First, it seems that we need to set the position of the element to fixed.
It should not be affected by the normal flow of the document. 
It should just always stay at the top.
